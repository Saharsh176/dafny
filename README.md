Task 1:
Write a method to compute the absolute value of an integer variable. The signature of the method is 
method Abs(x: int) returns (x’ : int)
Write appropriate precondition and postcondition to verify your code. [4]

Task 2:
Write a method to find the index of the first occurrence of a negative number in an array. The signature of 
the method is 
method FindFirstNegative(a: array<int>) returns (index: int)
Write appropriate preconditions and postconditions to verify your code. 
Also, write the loop invariant for partial correctness and the loop variant for total correctness. [4]

Task 3:
Write a method to compute the factorial of a positive integer. Write appropriate preconditions and 
postconditions to verify the correctness your code. Also, write the loop invariant for partial correctness and 
the loop variant for total correctness. [8]

Task 4:
Write a method to compute the nth term of the Tribonacci Sequence. The Tribonacci Sequence is defined as 
Tn = Tn-1 + Tn-2 + Tn-3, where T0 = 0, T1 = 1, T2 = 1. 
Ensure that you write an iterative implementation. Write appropriate preconditions and postconditions to 
verify the correctness of your code. Also, write the loop invariant for partial correctness and the loop variant 
for total correctness. [10]

Task 5: 
Record the outputs of your experiments in an HTML file. For each task, record different preconditions, 
postconditions, loop invariants, and loop variants, and test your code, including the cases where verification 
failed. [4]
